Rules:
- Use only what the text says. Leave a field empty ("" or null) rather than guess.
- gradYear, degree and branch describe their IIT Guwahati (IITG) degree only. Map the branch to the closest of the allowed values (e.g. "Electronics and Communication Engineering", "ECE", "electronics" -> ECE; "Computer Science", "CS" -> CSE; "Mathematics and Computing", "MnC" -> MnC; "Engineering Physics" -> EP; "Chemical" -> "CL (Chemical)"; "Biotech", "Biosciences" -> BSBE; "Mech" -> ME). If only a date range is given, gradYear is the end year. A batch written as "2005 batch", "class of '05" or "05 pass-out" means gradYear 2005.${about ? ' If they give only the year they joined ("joined in 2001"), add 4 for a B.Tech.' : ""}
- iitgFound is true only if the text shows they studied at IIT Guwahati / IITG${about ? " (in this self-description, assume they did unless they say otherwise, but only set gradYear and branch if stated)" : " (in Education)"}.
- jobTitle and organization are their current role${about ? "" : " (the experience entry with no end date, or the most recent)"}. Tidy capitalisation and obvious speech-to-text errors in company names.
- city: where they live or work now, if stated.
- skills: up to 12 concrete skills and domains a student could ask about, drawn from what they have actually done (e.g. "Embedded systems", "Android performance", "Product strategy", "Fundraising"). No soft skills like "Leadership" unless that's clearly their specialty.
- adviceAreas: pick 3 to 8 areas from the allowed list.${about ? " Start with what they say students can come to them for, then add areas where their own hands-on experience would genuinely help." : " Pick areas where their own hands-on experience would genuinely help a student: the technical domains they have worked in, the career paths they have actually taken, and startup or higher-studies areas only if the profile shows them (e.g. founded a company, did an MS/PhD/MBA)."}
- bio: 2-3 sentences in first person about their path since IITG, what they've built, and what students can ask them about, under 350 characters. Keep their voice and facts; plain, no hype.
- gaps: up to 3 short, friendly questions (under 90 characters each) asking for things that are missing and would most improve matching, in this priority: IITG batch year and branch; current role and organization; concrete things they have built or worked on hands-on; what students could come to them for. Address them as "you". Return [] if nothing important is missing.
